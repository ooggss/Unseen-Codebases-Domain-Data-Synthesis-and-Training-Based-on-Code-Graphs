/**
 * @file reaction.h
 * @brief Main entry point for the Reaction reactive programming framework
 *
 * This is the primary header file that provides access to all Reaction framework
 * functionality. Include this file to get complete access to reactive programming
 * features including:
 *
 * - Reactive variables, calculations, and expressions
 * - Observer pattern implementation
 * - Batch operations for performance optimization
 * - Thread-safe reactive operations
 * - Flexible invalidation and triggering strategies
